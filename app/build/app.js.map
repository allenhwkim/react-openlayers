vector layer. The styling in this example is quite involved. Single earthquake locations (rendered as stars) have a size relative to their magnitude. Clusters have an opacity relative to the number of features in the cluster, and a size that represents the extent of the features that make up the cluster. When clicking or hovering on a cluster, the individual features that make up the cluster will be shown.\n        To achieve this, we make heavy use of style functions and ol.style.Style#geometry.\n
