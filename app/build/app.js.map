The styling in this example is quite involved. Single earthquake locations (rendered as stars) have a size relative to their magnitude. Clusters have an opacity relative to the number of features in the cluster, and a size that represents the extent of the features that make up the cluster. When clicking or hovering on a cluster, the individual features that make up the cluster will be shown.\n        To achieve this, we make heavy use of style functions and ol.style.Style#geometry.\n

map.\n *\n * ### The view states\n *\n * An `ol.View` is determined by three states: `center`, `resolution`,\n * and `rotation`. Each state has a corresponding getter and setter, e.g.\n * `getCenter` and `setCenter` for the `center` state.\n *\n * An `ol.View` has a `projection`. The projection determines the\n * coordinate system of the center, and its units determine the units of the\n * resolution (projection units per pixel). The default projection is\n * Spherical Mercator (EPSG:3857).\n *\n * ### The constraints\n *\n * `setCenter`, `setResolution` and `setRotation` can be used to change the\n * states of the view. Any value can be passed to the setters. And the value\n * that is passed to a setter will effectively be the value set in the view,\n * and returned by the corresponding getter.\n *\n * But an `ol.View` object also has a *resolution constraint*, a\n * *rotation constraint* and a *center constraint*.\n *\n * As said above, no constraints are applied when the setters are used to set\n * new states for the view. Applying constraints is done explicitly through\n * the use of the `constrain*` functions (`constrainResolution` and\n * `constrainRotation` and `constrainCenter`).\n *\n * The main users of the constraints are the interactions and the\n * controls. For example, double-clicking on the map changes the view to\n * the \"next\" resolution. And releasing the fingers after pinch-zooming\n * snaps to the closest resolution (with an animation).\n *\n * The *resolution constraint* snaps to specific resolutions. It is\n * determined by the following options: `resolutions`, `maxResolution`,\n * `maxZoom`, and `zoomFactor`. If `resolutions` is set, the other three\n * options are ignored. See documentation for each option for more\n * information.\n *\n * The *rotation constraint* snaps to specific angles. It is determined\n * by the following options: `enableRotation` and `constrainRotation`.\n * By default the rotation value is snapped to zero when approaching the\n * horizontal.\n *\n * The *center constraint* is determined by the `extent` option. By\n * default the center is not constrained at all.\n *\n * @constructor\n * @extends {ol.Object}\n * @param {olx.ViewOptions=} opt_options View options.\n * @api stable\n */\nvar _ol_View_ = function(opt_options) {\n  _ol_Object_.call(this);\n  var options = opt_options || {};\n\n  /**\n   * @private\n   * @type {Array.<number>}\n   */\n  this.hints_ = [0, 0];\n\n  /**\n   * @private\n   * @type {Array.<Array.<ol.ViewAnimation>>}\n   */\n  this.animations_ = [];\n\n  /**\n   * @private\n   * @type {number|undefined}\n   */\n  this.updateAnimationKey_;\n\n  this.updateAnimations_ = this.updateAnimations_.bind(this);\n\n  /**\n   * @type {Object.<string, *>}\n   */\n  var properties = {};\n  properties[_ol_ViewProperty_.CENTER] = options.center !== undefined ?\n      options.center : null;\n\n  /**\n   * @private\n   * @const\n   * @type {ol.proj.Projection}\n   */\n  this.projection_ = _ol_proj_.createProjection(options.projection, 'EPSG:3857');\n\n  var resolutionConstraintInfo = _ol_View_.createResolutionConstraint_(\n      options);\n\n  /**\n   * @private\n   * @type {number}\n   */\n  this.maxResolution_ = resolutionConstraintInfo.maxResolution;\n\n  /**\n   * @private\n   * @type {number}\n   */\n  this.minResolution_ = resolutionConstraintInfo.minResolution;\n\n  /**\n   * @private\n   * @type {number}\n   */\n  this.zoomFactor_ = resolutionConstraintInfo.zoomFactor;\n\n  /**\n   * @private\n   * @type {Array.<number>|undefined}\n   */\n  this.resolutions_ = options.resolutions;\n\n  /**\n   * @private\n   * @type {number}\n   */\n  this.minZoom_ = resolutionConstraintInfo.minZoom;\n\n  var centerConstraint = _ol_View_.createCenterConstraint_(options);\n  var resolutionConstraint = resolutionConstraintInfo.constraint;\n  var rotationConstraint = _ol_View_.createRotationConstraint_(options);\n\n  /**\n   * @private\n   * @type {ol.Constraints}\n   */\n  this.constraints_ = new _ol_Constraints_(\n      centerConstraint, resolutionConstraint, rotationConstraint);\n\n  if (options.resolution !== undefined) {\n    properties[_ol_ViewProperty_.RESOLUTION] = options.resolution;\n  } else if (options.zoom !== undefined) {\n    properties[_ol_ViewProperty_.RESOLUTION] = this.constrainResolution(\n        this.maxResolution_, options.zoom - this.minZoom_);\n  }\n  properties[_ol_ViewProperty_.ROTATION] =\n      options.rotation !== undefined ? options.rotation : 0;\n  this.setProperties(properties);\n};\n\n_ol_.inherits(_ol_View_, _ol_Object_);\n\n\n/**\n * Animate the view.
