Base class that calls user-defined functions on down, move and up events. 
This class also manages "drag sequences".

When the handleDownEvent user function returns true a drag sequence is started. 
During a drag sequence the handleDragEvent user function is called on move events.
The drag sequence ends when the handleUpEvent user function is called and returns false. 

A react representative of of `new PointerInteraction(options)`.
