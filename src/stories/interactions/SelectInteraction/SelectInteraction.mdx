# {'<SelectInteractionControl />'}

Interaction for selecting vector features. By default, selected features are styled differently, 
so this interaction can be used for visual highlighting, as well as selecting features for other
actions, such as modification or output. There are three ways of controlling which features 
are selected: using the browser event as defined by the condition and optionally the toggle, 
add/remove, and multi options; a layers filter; and a further feature filter using the filter option.

A react representative of of `new Select(options)`.

### Usage
```typescript
import OSM from 'ol/source/OSM';
import {Map, TileLayer, View, SelectInteraction, VectorLayer} from '../../../lib';
import Point from 'ol/geom/Point';
import LineString from 'ol/geom/LineString';
import Polygon from 'ol/geom/Polygon';
import VectorSource from 'ol/source/Vector';
import Feature from 'ol/Feature';

export default function(props) {
  const pointFeature = new Feature( new Point([0, 0]));
  const lineFeature = new Feature( new LineString([ [-1e7, 1e6], [-1e6, 3e6] ])) ;
  const polygonFeature = new Feature(
    new Polygon([ [ [-3e6, -1e6], [-3e6, 1e6], [-1e6, 1e6], [-1e6, -1e6], [-3e6, -1e6] ] ]),
  );
  const source = new VectorSource({
    features: [pointFeature, lineFeature, polygonFeature],
  })

  function onSelect(e) {
    console.log('selected', e.target.getFeatures().getLength());
    console.log('deselected', e.deselected.length);
  };

  return (
    <Map>
      <TileLayer source={new OSM()} />
      <VectorLayer source={source} />
      <View center={[0, 0]} zoom={2}/>
      <SelectInteraction onSelect={onSelect} />
    </Map>
  );
}
```
